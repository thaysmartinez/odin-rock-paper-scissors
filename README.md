# Rock Paper Scissors

## Introduction

This is the second iteration of the game "Rock Paper Scissors" implementation. This time I included a simple user interface to improve the gaming experience.

In this game you will play against the computer the grade-class "Rock, Paper and Scissors" directly on the browser.
After each round, the running score is displayed. Wins who reaches 5 points first.
